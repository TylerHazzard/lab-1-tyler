# Welcome Students!

Welcome to our Grand Circus class repository. This repository houses all the code we will work on during class.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. Here's how:

1. **Open Terminal in VSCode.**

   - You can do this by going to `Terminal -> New Terminal` in VSCode. The terminal will open at the bottom of your VSCode window.
   - Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `` CTRL + ```.

2. **Open Your Grand Circus Projects Folder.**

   - Navigate to the folder where you keep your Grand Circus materials in bash. Make sure the folder you pick is a good one to clone materials into from GitHub.

3. **Copy the Repository URL.**

   - Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub in your web browser.
   - Click the green `Code` button.
   - Click the clipboard icon to copy the repository URL.

4. **Clone the repository.**

   - In the terminal in VSCode, clone the repository by running the following command, replacing `url` with the repository URL you copied:<br><br>

   ```bash
   git clone url
   ```

5. **Navigate to the repository directory.**

   - In your terminal, navigate into the new repository directory by running:<br><br>

   ```bash
   cd JavaScriptBootcamp_July2023_AH
   ```

6. **Pull from `main`.**

   - Before starting work, ensure you have the latest code by pulling from the `main` branch:<br><br>

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

Now, you can open the directory in VSCode and review whatever we went over that day. When I push up the day's folder, navigate back to the JavaScriptBootcamp_July2023_AH directory and git pull again to download the new materials to your local.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Happy coding!
